<p>Forever can never be long enough for me<br />To feel like I've had long enough with you<br />Forget the world now, we won't let them see<br />But there's one thing left to do</p>
<p>Now that the weight has lifted<br />Love has surely shifted my way</p>
<p>Marry me<br />Today and every day<br />Marry me<br />If I ever get the nerve to say "Hello" in this caf&eacute;<br />Say you will<br />Mm-hmm<br />Say you will<br />Mm-hmm</p>
<p>Together can never be close enough for me<br />To feel like I am close enough to you<br />You wear white and I'll wear out the words "I love you"<br />And "You're beautiful"</p>
<p>Now that the wait is over<br />And love has finally shown her my way</p>
<p>Marry me<br />Today and every day<br />Marry me<br />If I ever get the nerve to say "Hello" in this caf&eacute;<br />Say you will<br />Mm-hmm<br />Say you will<br />Mm-hmm</p>
<p>Promise me<br />You'll always be<br />Happy by my side<br />I promise to<br />Sing to you<br />When all the music dies</p>
<p>And marry me<br />Today and everyday<br />Marry me<br />If I ever get the nerve to say "Hello" in this caf&eacute;<br />Say you will<br />Mm-hmm<br />Say you will<br />Mm-hmm</p>
<p>Marry me<br />Mm-hmm</p>
